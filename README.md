# Infinite-Scroll

The goal of this project is how to implement infinite scroll functionality like something that happens on social media as the user scrolls near the bottom of the page another request is made before you reach the bottom of the page.

The images are photos fetched from the Unsplash API. It is one long column of images with a margin on the left and right and as we get closer to the bottom another request is made and we are fetching more images.

Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

Make any styling changes you would like Of course, all of the code is there and nothing is hidden from you so if you would like to make any other styling changes, feel free!

Have fun building!
